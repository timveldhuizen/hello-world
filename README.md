# hello-world

Hi everyone.

I'm new to github. Besides being a professional developer for my work, I also work on some stuff at home.
I started programming in the 1980's (when I was about 6 or 7 years old) with the Canon V-20 MSX Home computer
and these days I'm very experienced with the Delphi language and IDE which i've been working with for over 12 years.

Professionally I've worked on some financial/administrative systems, television media graphics (2d/3d character
generator software), tools for processing news articles and a system for planning the maintenance of aircraft engines
(which included some work on machine learning, which got me interested in AI).

Besides my work, I also still make some software at home. I've built some demo applications showing some basics of
neural networking and I'm working on a general purpose, object oriented programming language and compiler (N:Code.X)
which I will eventually be open sourcing.

Greetz,
Tim.
